Mike was here.

Emi loves Mike very much

Emi is learning Git and is pulling out her hair because she is frustrated. Kiki.
I still don't understand this completelly.

Yes, you do.  This cheatsheet will help.  Add HTML formatting to make it easier to read notes vs commands:

Switch to master
git checkout master
pull down latest version of master
git pull
switch to emiluz
git checkout emiluz
merge master changes into emiluz
git merge master
make your changes in Sublime
commit and push changes to emiluz
git add *
git commit –m “my changes”
git push
merge emiluz changes in to master
git checkout master
git merge emiluz
git push
>>>>>>> master

this is a nightmare !!
